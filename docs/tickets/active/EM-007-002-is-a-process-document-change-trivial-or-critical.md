# EM-007-002 — Is a change to a process document trivial or critical?

## Context

Raised by the independent review of EM-007 (round 2, finding 12) and again
by the review of EM-012-001 (round 2, finding R2.2). Two published
statements give different answers for the same change.

ADR-0002's Context: "Changes to process documents are process-surface
changes, which the operative test classifies as critical. So this is not a
rare case: on a repository whose content *is* process documentation, most
substantive work is critical tier."

`docs/tier-review-model.md`, "The operative test", as EM-012-001 leaves it:
a change is `trivial` where "nothing a program executes and nothing a
caller reads as a contract is touched", and the tier table's `trivial` row
names documentation and ticket edits. A process document is read by
contributors, not by programs.

So a one-word fix to `docs/ticket-lifecycle.md` is `critical` by the
decision record and `trivial` by the model. Four tickets closed here on the
narrow reading — that ADR-0002 governs changes altering a rule or a
procedure, and not other documentation edits — and each recorded that
reading in its own Notes: EM-007-001, EM-010-002, EM-012-001-001, and the
entries of the batch EM-017. The reading is nowhere in the model or the
record it interprets.

## Specification

This ticket carries a question the contributor policy's §3 reserves to the
maintainer. It is not ambiguous — both readings are coherent — and it is
not the executor's to answer, because it resolves a conflict between a
decision record and the model that record governs, and because one of the
two available answers removes a control from the party the control is on.

The answers available, with what each costs:

1. **ADR-0002 governs as written.** Every change to a process document is
   `critical` and summons an independent reviewer. Cost: a typo fix in the
   lifecycle costs a review round; the batching path EM-012 added becomes
   unusable on this repository, because nothing here would ever be
   `trivial`; the four tickets closed on the narrow reading were closed at
   the wrong tier, and the record should say so.
2. **The narrow reading governs, and is written down.** A change to a
   process document is `critical` when it adds, alters or retires a rule or
   a procedure, and `trivial` when it does not. Cost: the line between
   "alters a rule" and "does not" is drawn by the executor, at the moment
   the executor would like the answer to be `trivial` — which is the
   failure ADR-0001's Alternative 3 rejected in a different form. The
   mitigation is that the executor may never lower a tier, only raise it.
3. **Something else**, including amending ADR-0002 under the
   amendment-with-record path, which is itself `critical` work.

What the executor needs in order to proceed: the maintainer's choice among
those, or a different one. The implementer then writes it into
`docs/tier-review-model.md` where the operative test states the `trivial`
line, records the decision per `docs/adr-process.md` since it is a workflow
rule changing, and — under answer 1 — corrects the record of the four
tickets closed at `trivial`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. AC1: `docs/tier-review-model.md` states, in one or two sentences, when a
   change to a process document is `critical` and when it is `trivial`.
2. AC2: The statement and ADR-0002 agree, or ADR-0002 is amended with a
   record per "Retiring a control".
3. AC3: The rule carries a **Retired when:** line.
4. AC4: Every ticket already closed at a tier the decision contradicts is
   named in the pull-request description, with what the record does about
   it.
5. AC5: Critical tier per ADR-0002: an independent agent reviews this
   against the artifacts and records findings in two columns.

## Out of scope

- Any change to the operative test's five clauses.
- Any change to what each tier requires. This ticket decides which tier a
  class of change is, not what that tier costs.

## References

- ADR-0002, Context — the sentence one reading follows.
- `docs/tier-review-model.md`, "The operative test" and "The tiers".
- ADR-0001, Alternative 3 — "'substantive' is decided by the person who
  wants the exemption, and the exemption widens", which is the hazard in
  answer 2.
- EM-007-001, EM-010-002, EM-012-001-001, EM-017 — closed on the narrow
  reading.

## Notes

The question is small and its answer is load-bearing: it decides whether
this repository's own work is reviewable at the cost it has been paying, or
at several times that cost.

**BLOCKER (2026-09-06) — discharged 2026-09-07 by the decision below. The
text is left as the record of why the work stopped.** The executor cannot
proceed. The Specification
above states a question that §3 reserves to the maintainer: which of ADR-0002
and the operative test governs the tier of a process-document change. Both
readings are coherent, so this is not ambiguity, and the test §3 states is
who answers rather than whether the executor could. Answering it in the diff
— by writing either reading into the model and seeing whether anyone
objects — is the invention §3 forbids, and it would be the executor choosing
which tier its own future work carries.

To proceed the executor needs the maintainer's choice among the three
answers stated above, or a fourth. Answer 1 additionally requires a decision
about the four tickets already closed at `trivial` on the narrow reading:
whether the record is corrected, or the closures stand and the rule applies
from the decision forward.

**Maintainer's decision (2026-09-07): answer 2.** The narrow reading
governs, and is written down. A change to a process document is `critical`
when it adds, alters or retires a rule or a procedure, and `trivial` when it
does not.

The reasoning recorded with the decision, in three parts:

- It matches what four closed tickets already did. EM-007-001, EM-010-002,
  EM-012-001-001 and the entries of the batch EM-017 each recorded the
  narrow reading in their own Notes and closed at `trivial` on it.
- It keeps the batching path `docs/ticket-lifecycle.md`, "Batching trivial
  work", added usable on this repository. Answer 1 would have removed it,
  because under answer 1 nothing here would ever be `trivial`.
- The acknowledged cost stands and is accepted: the line between "alters a
  rule" and "does not" is drawn by the executor, at the moment the executor
  would like the answer to be `trivial`. The mitigation is the
  separation-of-duties rule — an executor may raise a tier and may never
  lower it — and the written line is what a reviewer holds a `trivial`
  claim against.

The four tickets closed on this reading therefore stand and need no
correction. Correcting them was a consequence of answer 1, which was not
chosen.
